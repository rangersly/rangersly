## About me
I'm a student from China. Please forgive me, my English is extremely poor, but I am improving it as soon as possible.  
I'm also an amateur radio enthusiast, and my call sign is BH5UOK.
My email address is: 2281598291@qq.com

## My ability
My main programming language is C/CPP.   
I became an algorithm contestant in 2020, and that was my first exposure to programming. Now I have mastered the development of modern CPP and C language microcontrollers, and can use the Linux system proficiently.
